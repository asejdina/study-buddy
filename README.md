Study-Buddy
=================

A project designed to test skills and abilities in team work, object oriented programming, MongoDB, and Node.js through the development of a Learning Management System.

The biggest lesson learned on this project was the importance of preparation. Approximately 10 hours of planning went into this project before any code was written, and the end result reflected that level of planning.

My responsibilities on this project:
* Writing of all of the backend code on the “Teacher’s” side of the application.
* Front end design of the application.
